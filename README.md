# Netflix Data Cleaning Project

This project focuses on cleaning and standardizing the **Netflix Movies and TV Shows dataset** to prepare it for further analysis and visualization.

## 📋 Project Overview
The raw dataset contained missing values, inconsistent data types, and formatting issues. The goal was to clean, structure, and prepare the dataset for business and analytical use cases.

## 🧹 Steps Performed
1. **Data Loading** – Imported raw Netflix dataset into Python using Pandas.
2. **Data Inspection** – Identified null values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
3. **Data Cleaning** – 
   - Removed duplicates and null records.  
   - Standardized categorical fields (e.g., country names, date formats).  
   - Handled missing values using appropriate imputation techniques.
4. **Data Transformation** – Converted columns like `release_year` and `date_added` into suitable formats for analysis.
5. **Output** – Generated a cleaned version of the dataset ready for visualization and analytics.
